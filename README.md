# A Universal Standard for Predictive Signals (UPSS)

The growing ease by which large language models can extract structured data from unstructured data generates vast streams of time-sensitive data across nearly every industry. This data holds immense potential for predictive modeling, enabling organizations to anticipate future events, optimize operations, and gain competitive advantages. However, realizing this potential is often hindered by significant challenges. A primary obstacle is the lack of standardization in how predictive signals – the raw metrics, indicators, and scores derived from this data – are represented and exchanged. Similar to the interoperability issues faced by general event data before initiatives like CloudEvents, the absence of a common format for predictive signals forces developers to build custom ingestion and processing logic for each data source, stifling innovation and reuse.

Furthermore, transforming these raw signals into actionable predictions typically demands considerable domain expertise and manual effort. Data scientists and machine learning engineers invest significant time in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and validation – processes that are often bespoke to specific use cases. This high barrier to entry prevents many organizations from effectively leveraging their data for predictive tasks. There exists a clear need for platforms that can automate the complex workflow from raw signal data to prediction, democratizing predictive capabilities and accelerating time-to-value.

The **Universal Predictive Signal Standard (UPSS)** aims to establish a flexible and extensible format for representing diverse predictive signals as time-ordered events. Drawing inspiration from the success of CloudEvents in standardizing general event metadata , UPSS focuses specifically on structuring data intended as input for predictive modeling. It defines a core set of metadata attributes for context and provides clear guidelines for structuring the signal payload itself, ensuring compatibility with automated processing techniques while maintaining broad applicability.

## A. Foundational Principles

The design of the Universal Predictive Signal Standard (UPSS) is guided by several foundational principles aimed at ensuring its broad applicability, longevity, and ease of use. These principles draw inspiration from established standards like CloudEvents and concepts from Universal Design.

1. **Industry/Use-Case Agnosticism:** The standard must be fundamentally versatile, capable of representing predictive signals from any domain, whether it be financial markets, industrial IoT, e-commerce user behavior, healthcare monitoring, or logistics. Achieving this requires a deliberate avoidance of domain-specific terminology or structures within the core specification. Instead, the standard relies on a minimal, universally relevant core and robust extensibility mechanisms to accommodate specific industry needs. This aligns with the Universal Design principle of Equitable Use, making the standard useful to the widest possible audience of data producers.
2. **Extensibility:** Recognizing that the landscape of predictive signals will inevitably evolve, the standard must be inherently extensible. It needs to gracefully accommodate new types of signals, additional metadata, or evolving data structures without necessitating breaking changes to the core specification. This mirrors a key design goal of CloudEvents, which uses extension attributes to add context , and reflects best practices in flexible schema design where systems can adapt to unforeseen future requirements. Flexibility in use is paramount.
3. **Time-Sensitivity:** Predictive signals are inherently temporal. The standard must rigorously preserve the time dimension, capturing the precise moment an observation or measurement occurred. This is critical not only for understanding the sequence of events but also for enabling essential time-series analysis techniques, such as calculating lags, rolling aggregates, and trends. Accurate timestamps are fundamental for ensuring point-in-time correctness during model training and prediction, preventing the leakage of future information into features.
4. **Simplicity and Intuitive Use:** To encourage widespread adoption, the standard must be straightforward to understand, implement, and validate. Unnecessary complexity acts as a barrier  and contradicts the Universal Design principle of Simple and Intuitive Use. The structure should be logical and the core concepts easily grasped by developers integrating with the standard.

A critical balance must be struck between agnosticism and utility. A standard that is too generic might lack the necessary structural cues for efficient automated processing by generalized predictive algorithms. Conversely, embedding too much specific structure would compromise its industry-agnostic nature. The design must therefore define a minimal but meaningful core structure, particularly optimized for time-series data representation (e.g., clear identification of entity, timestamp, and signal values), while relying heavily on well-defined extension mechanisms and payload flexibility to handle diversity. The design of the data payload is thus central to UPSS's success, needing sufficient structure to hint at fundamental data types (numerical, categorical, score) while remaining adaptable. CloudEvents successfully navigated this balance for general event metadata; UPSS must adapt this philosophy for the specific needs of predictive signal data.

## B. Leveraging CloudEvents for Context Metadata

Instead of reinventing the fundamental structure for event metadata, UPSS leverages the CloudEvents specification. CloudEvents, developed under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), provides a mature, widely adopted, and well-documented standard for describing event data in a common way, significantly simplifying interoperability across services and platforms. By adopting the CloudEvents envelope structure, UPSS benefits from existing tooling, SDKs in multiple languages (Go, Java, Python, C#, etc.) , and established integration patterns within the event-driven ecosystem.

UPSS utilizes the following CloudEvents context attributes, assigning specific semantics relevant to predictive signals :

- **`id` (REQUIRED):** A unique identifier for this specific signal event instance (e.g., a UUID). Essential for idempotency, deduplication, and tracing event lineage. Producers must ensure uniqueness within the scope of the `source`.
- **`source` (REQUIRED):** Identifies the context or entity that generated the signal. This is a critical field for UPSS, mapping directly to the **Entity ID** (e.g., a specific sensor ID, user ID, machine ID, stock ticker symbol). It allows a predictive platform to group signals belonging to the same logical entity over time. Represented as a URI-reference, ideally absolute.
- **`specversion` (REQUIRED):** Specifies the version of the UPSS standard being used (e.g., `"UPSS-1.0"`). This is distinct from the CloudEvents `specversion` (which would be "1.0") and allows UPSS to evolve independently.
- **`type` (REQUIRED):** Describes the *category* or *nature* of the signal event, providing high-level classification. Examples: `com.example.iot.sensor.reading`, `com.example.finance.stock.price`, `com.example.webapp.user.clickstream`. This helps in initial routing or schema association but does not contain the specific signal name or value, which reside in the `data` payload. It should be descriptive and ideally prefixed with a reverse-DNS name.
- **`time` (REQUIRED):** The timestamp indicating when the signal occurred or was measured. Must conform to RFC 3339 format (e.g., `2023-10-27T10:00:00Z`). This is the core temporal anchor for time-series analysis and point-in-time lookups.
- **`datacontenttype` (REQUIRED):** Specifies the media type of the `data` payload, such as `application/json` or `application/protobuf`. Essential for the consumer to correctly parse the signal values. While optional in base CloudEvents, it's mandatory for UPSS as the payload structure is key.
- **`subject` (Optional):** Identifies the subject of the event in the context of the `source`. Could potentially be used to name the specific signal if a very simple payload structure is used, but embedding signal names within the structured `data` payload is generally preferred for clarity and flexibility when multiple signals are present.
- **`dataschema` (Optional):** A URI pointing to a schema (e.g., a JSON Schema or Protobuf schema definition) that the `data` payload adheres to. Highly recommended for complex payloads to aid validation and interpretation by consumers.

Essentially, CloudEvents provides the standardized *envelope* for transporting the predictive signal. UPSS builds upon this by mandating specific attributes essential for predictive contexts (like `time`, `source`, `datacontenttype`) and, crucially, defining the expected structure and semantics *within* the `data` payload, tailored for consumption by automated ML systems. This approach avoids redundant effort in defining basic event metadata and allows UPSS to focus on the specific requirements of representing predictive signal values effectively.

## C. UPSS Schema Definition

The UPSS schema combines the CloudEvents context attributes with a flexible yet structured definition for the `data` payload, designed to accommodate diverse signal types and facilitate automated processing.

**1. Core Context Attributes:** As detailed in Section II.B, UPSS mandates the use of `id`, `source`, `specversion` (UPSS-specific), `type`, `time`, and `datacontenttype` from the CloudEvents specification. `source` serves as the Entity ID, and `time` provides the essential timestamp. Optional attributes like `subject` and `dataschema` can provide additional context or validation guidance.

**2. Flexible Payload Design (`data` attribute):** This attribute contains the actual signal measurements or observations. While technically optional in CloudEvents , the `data` attribute is the primary carrier of information in UPSS and will almost always be present. Its design must handle the specified data types:

- **Handling Mixed Data Types:**
    - *Numerical Metrics:* These represent quantitative measurements (e.g., temperature, voltage, transaction amount, latency). Standard JSON `number` (which includes integers and floats)  or Protobuf types (`float`, `double`, `int32`, `int64`, etc.)  are suitable. JSON Schema allows constraints like `minimum`, `maximum`, and `multipleOf` for validation.
    - *Categorical Indicators:* These represent qualitative states or labels (e.g., machine status 'running'/'stopped', user segment 'A'/'B'/'C', event type 'click'/'purchase'). Typically represented as strings. JSON Schema's `string` type, potentially with an `enum` constraint for predefined categories , is appropriate. Protobuf uses `string` or its own `enum` type. Accurate representation of categorical data is vital for many classification and feature engineering tasks.
    - *Scores:* These are often derived values representing likelihood, rank, or quality (e.g., risk score, relevance score, quality rating). They are usually numerical (integer or float), often within a specific range (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0, 1 to 100). JSON Schema's range constraints (`minimum`, `maximum`, `exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`)  or Protobuf validation rules can enforce these bounds.
- **Payload Format Recommendation (JSON vs. Protobuf):**
The choice of serialization format for the `data` payload significantly impacts usability, performance, and flexibility.
    - *JSON:* Offers excellent human readability, widespread ecosystem support (parsers, libraries, validation via JSON Schema ), and inherent flexibility for representing nested structures and mixed data types (using arrays like `type: ["string", "number"]` ). Its primary drawbacks are potentially larger message sizes and slower parsing speeds compared to binary formats.
    - *Protobuf:* Provides a compact binary format, leading to smaller message sizes and significantly faster serialization/deserialization. It has strong support for schema evolution, ensuring compatibility between different versions of producers and consumers. However, it is not human-readable, requires a schema compilation step (`.proto` files) , and handling arbitrary mixed types within a single payload field is less straightforward than in JSON, often requiring techniques like `oneof` fields or the `google.protobuf.Any` type. Integration often involves a schema registry for managing `.proto` definitions.
    
   For a universal standard prioritizing ease of adoption, flexibility, and human readability, **JSON** is recommended as the primary `datacontenttype` for the UPSS `data` payload. A corresponding JSON Schema should be defined and referenced via the `dataschema` attribute for validation and clarity. **Protobuf** should be offered as a fully supported *alternative* `datacontenttype` for use cases where performance and payload size are critical concerns. A standardized Protobuf message definition mirroring the recommended JSON structure can be provided.
    

| Feature | JSON | Protobuf |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Readability** | High (Human-readable text) | Low (Binary format) |
| **Performance (Parsing)** | Moderate to Slow | Fast |
| **Size Efficiency** | Lower (Text-based, verbose) | Higher (Compact binary encoding) |
| **Schema Enforcement** | Good (via JSON Schema) | Strong (via `.proto` definition, compile-time) |
| **Flexibility (Mixed Types)** | High (Native support) | Moderate (Requires `oneof`, `Any`, or wrappers) |
| **Ecosystem Support** | Very Wide | Wide (especially gRPC, Kafka ecosystems) |
| **Ease of Adoption** | High (No compilation needed) | Moderate (Requires schema compilation) |
- **Representing Multiple Signals per Timestamp/Entity:** A common scenario involves an entity emitting several different signal values simultaneously (e.g., a server reporting CPU, memory, and network metrics at the same timestamp). UPSS must handle this efficiently.
    - *Option 1: Multiple UPSS Events:* Emit a separate UPSS event for each signal (e.g., one for CPU, one for memory). The `data` payload would be simple, containing just one signal's name and value (e.g., `{"signal_name": "cpu_usage", "value": 0.75}`). This approach is straightforward but significantly increases the number of events, potentially impacting ingestion throughput and storage costs.
    - *Option 2: Single UPSS Event with Structured Payload:* Emit a single UPSS event containing all signals for that entity at that specific timestamp. The `data` payload would need a structure to hold multiple signal-value pairs.
        - *Object Approach:* Use a JSON object where keys are the signal names and values are the signal readings: `{"cpu_usage": 0.75, "memory_usage": 0.60, "disk_io": 120.5, "status": "healthy"}`. This is concise, intuitive, and maps well to common programming structures. It assumes signal names are relatively stable.
        - *Array Approach:* Use a JSON array where each element represents a single signal with its name, value, and potentially its type: `[{"name": "cpu_usage", "value": 0.75, "type": "numerical"}, {"name": "status", "value": "active", "type": "categorical"}, {"name": "alert_score", "value": 85, "type": "score"}]`. This is more verbose but explicitly declares the type of each signal, making it highly flexible for scenarios with dynamic or a very large number of signals where keys might not be known beforehand.
    
    This specification recommends the **Single UPSS Event with Structured Payload (Object Approach)** as the default structure within the `data` payload for its balance of simplicity, efficiency, and readability, especially when the set of signals per entity is relatively stable. However, the **Array Approach** is a viable alternative for use cases involving highly dynamic signal sets or where explicit per-signal type declaration within the payload is advantageous. The `dataschema` attribute should be used to clearly define which payload structure is being employed.
    
**3. Extensibility Mechanisms:** UPSS provides two primary ways to extend the standard:

- **CloudEvents Extension Attributes:** For adding custom *metadata* about the event itself, beyond the core UPSS/CloudEvents attributes, the standard CloudEvents extension mechanism should be used. These are top-level attributes alongside `id`, `source`, etc. (e.g., `{"datacenter_region": "us-east-1"}`). Extensions must follow CloudEvents naming conventions and type system. They are suitable for information needed for routing, filtering, or processing *before* parsing the main `data` payload.
- **Payload Extensibility:** For adding new signal types, signal attributes, or nested information *within* the signal data, the `data` payload itself should be extended. With the recommended JSON format, this is straightforward – new key-value pairs can simply be added to the JSON object (or new objects to the array, depending on the chosen structure). For more control, the associated JSON Schema can define whether `additionalProperties` are allowed or restricted. Nested JSON objects and arrays are naturally supported for complex signal structures.

A clear distinction exists between extending the event's context (metadata *about* the signal event) and extending the payload (the signal data *itself*). CloudEvents extensions are ideal for the former, while the inherent flexibility of the chosen payload format (especially JSON) handles the latter. This separation maintains the clarity of the core standard while allowing for rich, use-case-specific data representation. Documentation should guide implementers on when to use each mechanism: use CloudEvents extensions for metadata relevant to event infrastructure (routing, filtering) before payload parsing; use payload fields for the actual signal data intended for consumption by a consuming platform.

**4. Time-Series Data Modeling Considerations:** It is crucial to understand that UPSS defines the *event format* for data in transit or initial staging, not the *optimal storage schema* within a time-series database. The consuming platform has the flexibility to choose a storage strategy that best suits its query patterns and database technology.

- *Wide Table Approach:* A database table with columns `entity_id`, `timestamp`, `signal1_value`, `signal2_value`,.... Each row represents all known signals for an entity at a specific time. Querying across signals for a given time is simple. However, it can lead to sparse tables with many NULL values if signals are not always present, and adding new signal types requires altering the table schema.
- *Narrow Table Approach:* A database table with columns `entity_id`, `timestamp`, `signal_name`, `signal_value`. Each row represents a single signal observation. This handles sparse and dynamic signals efficiently, avoiding NULLs. Adding new signal types involves inserting new rows with the new `signal_name`. Querying across multiple signals for the same entity/time requires joins or pivot operations, which can add complexity.
- *Time Bucket Approach:* Rows represent time intervals (e.g., an hour, a day) for an entity. Multiple readings within the bucket might be stored in different columns, multiple timestamped cells within a column (as in Bigtable ), or as a serialized blob (e.g., Protobuf ). This can optimize storage and performance for time-range queries but increases implementation complexity.

The recommended UPSS payload structures (both the object and array approaches using JSON) can be readily mapped to either wide or narrow storage schemas during the ingestion process. The object payload maps naturally to a wide schema, while the array payload aligns well with a narrow schema. This decoupling of the event standard from the storage schema is a significant advantage. Different database technologies (e.g., SQL-based like TimescaleDB vs. NoSQL like Bigtable) and specific query requirements favor different storage layouts. Mandating a specific storage schema within UPSS would severely limit its universality and the ability of consuming platforms to optimize for performance and cost. Therefore, a consuming platform's ingestion layer must be designed with the flexibility to parse incoming UPSS events and efficiently map them to the chosen internal time-series database schema.

## D. Proposed UPSS Specification

The following table summarizes the core structure of a UPSS event, combining CloudEvents context attributes with UPSS-specific requirements and payload recommendations.

| Attribute Name | Source | Required/Optional | Data Type | Description (UPSS Semantics) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | CloudEvents | REQUIRED | String | Unique identifier for this signal event instance. Scope: unique per `source`. |
| `source` | CloudEvents | REQUIRED | URI-Reference | **Entity ID.** Identifies the entity generating the signal (e.g., sensor, user). Used for grouping signals over time. |
| `specversion` | UPSS Defined | REQUIRED | String | Version of the UPSS specification being used (e.g., "UPSS-1.0"). |
| `type` | CloudEvents | REQUIRED | String | High-level category of the signal event (e.g., `com.example.iot.reading`). Reverse-DNS notation recommended. |
| `time` | CloudEvents | REQUIRED | Timestamp (RFC 3339) | Timestamp of the signal occurrence or measurement. |
| `datacontenttype` | CloudEvents | REQUIRED | String | Media type of the `data` payload (e.g., `application/json`, `application/protobuf`). |
| `dataschema` | CloudEvents | OPTIONAL | URI | URI pointing to the schema definition (e.g., JSON Schema, Protobuf schema) for the `data` payload. Highly recommended for validation and interpretation. |
| `subject` | CloudEvents | OPTIONAL | String | Subject of the event within the `source` context. Can optionally identify the specific signal if not clear from `type` or `data`. |
| `data` | CloudEvents | OPTIONAL (but typically present for UPSS) | Varies (JSON Object/Array recommended) | The payload containing the actual signal values. Structure depends on `datacontenttype` and `dataschema`. See Section II.C.2 for recommended structures. |
| *(Extensions)* | CloudEvents | OPTIONAL | Varies | Additional custom context attributes outside the core spec, following CloudEvents extension rules. |

## E. Schema Versioning and Evolution Strategy

As the UPSS standard gains adoption and encounters new use cases, its definition – including core attributes, recommended payload structures, or officially recognized extensions – may need refinement or enhancement. A transparent and robust versioning strategy is therefore essential to manage changes predictably for both data producers and consumers.

- **Versioning Components:** Versioning needs to be applied clearly to:
    - **The UPSS Specification:** The overall standard document and its core requirements. This should be reflected in the mandatory `specversion` context attribute (e.g., `"UPSS-1.0"`, `"UPSS-1.1"`, `"UPSS-2.0"`).
    - **Payload Schemas (`dataschema`):** The structure defined within the `data` payload can evolve independently of the core UPSS spec version. Referencing versioned URIs in the `dataschema` attribute (e.g., `https://example.com/schemas/upss-payload/v1.2.json`) allows for this independent evolution.
- **Versioning Strategy:** Drawing from common practices in API and event schema versioning :
    - **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):** Apply the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning scheme  to both the `specversion` and the `dataschema` URIs.
        - MAJOR version increment (e.g., 1.x.x -> 2.0.0) signifies backward-incompatible changes.
        - MINOR version increment (e.g., 1.0.x -> 1.1.0) signifies backward-compatible additions or changes.
        - PATCH version increment (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1) signifies backward-compatible bug fixes or clarifications.
    - **Backward Compatibility Focus:** For MINOR and PATCH releases, prioritize backward compatibility. Consumers designed for an older version (e.g., UPSS-1.0) should still be able to process events conforming to a newer minor version (e.g., UPSS-1.1), typically by ignoring new, unrecognized fields or attributes. This minimizes disruption for consumers.
    - **Handling Breaking Changes (MAJOR Releases):** Backward-incompatible changes require a MAJOR version bump and necessitate explicit adaptation by signal consumers. During transition periods, the consumer may need to support ingesting and processing events conforming to multiple concurrent MAJOR versions (e.g., both UPSS-1.x and UPSS-2.0). Techniques like *upcasting* (transforming older event schemas to the newer format upon ingestion ) or maintaining version-specific processing logic within the ingestion pipeline can manage this transition.
    - **Schema Registry (Optional Service):** While the UPSS standard itself doesn't mandate a central registry, providing one as an optional service could be highly beneficial, especially for managing `dataschema` definitions (JSON Schema or Protobuf). A registry (akin to Confluent Schema Registry  or AWS Glue Schema Registry ) can store schemas, enforce compatibility rules (backward, forward, full ), and facilitate schema discovery.

The chosen schema evolution strategy directly influences the complexity of the consuming platform and the effort required by users (data producers) to adapt to changes. Frequent breaking changes create friction and necessitate significant development effort on the consumer side. Therefore, a strong emphasis on backward compatibility for MINOR/PATCH versions is crucial. The initial design of UPSS, particularly the payload structure, should be carefully considered to maximize flexibility and minimize the likelihood of future breaking changes. Extensibility points should be used judiciously. Clear documentation detailing the versioning policy, compatibility guarantees, and migration paths for breaking changes is paramount for building trust and ensuring smooth evolution.
